    title: "Charles Whitee",
    description:
      '<p>Adept in multiple artistic mediums, Charles White created bold, large-scale paintings and drawings that magnified the power of the black figure, communicating universal human themes while also focusing attention on the lives of African Americans and the struggle for equality. At a time when the art world increasingly favored abstraction, White developed a distinctive and labor-intensive approach to art making and remained committed to a representational style that explored social and political themes ranging from the ongoing fight for freedom and equality to the dignity and struggles of labor.</p><p>Born and educated in Chicago, White was one of the preeminent artists to emerge during the city’s Black Renaissance of the 1930s and 1940s. As a child, White sketched in the galleries of the Art Institute of Chicago and in grade school received an award to attend drawing classes at the museum. As a high school student he earned a scholarship to the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. White received other scholarships that were revoked because of his race, but this early support was critical in White’s path to becoming a professional artist, offering him exhibition opportunities, including the museum’s Twenty-First International Exhibition of Watercolors in 1942. </p><p><a href="/exhibitions/2663/charles-white-a-retrospective">A 2018 exhibition</a> at the Art Institute was the first major retrospective of White’s work in more than 35 years and showcased the talented and influential artist whose work continues to resonate amid today’s national dialogues about race, work, equality, and history.</p>',

    title: "Georgia O'Keeffe",
    description: `<p>One of the most influential American artists of the 20th century, Georgia O'Keeffe promoted new ideas of abstraction and helped redefine modern art. Best known for her paintings of flowers and plants—enlarged beyond life-size and precisely painted with bold colors—and for her spare and dramatic images inspired by the landscape of the Southwest, O'Keeffe also took inspiration in the aesthetic and architectural styles that she was exposed to during her time as a student at School of the Art Institute of Chicago.</p><p>Although she only spent one year at SAIC, leaving to recuperate from typhoid fever, she developed a loyalty to the institution, exhibiting <a href="https://www-2018.artic.edu/exhibitions/7588" target="_blank">her first retrospective at the museum in 1943</a>. After the death of her husband—photographer and art dealer Alfred Stieglitz—O’Keeffe donated his art collection, including his immense holdings of photography to the Art Institute.</p><p>While O’Keeffe incorporated elements from various modernist movements into her work, her style was entirely her own. Her ability to connect and infuse natural and abstracted forms with evocative visual and spiritual qualities contributed significantly to the innovations of American modernism.</p><p>O’Keeffe also differed from most other American pioneers of modernism in that she was trained entirely in the United States. Apart from her time in Chicago, O'Keeffe lived in Virginia, Texas, and South Carolina before moving permanently to New Mexico, where she worked almost until her death at the age of 98.</p>`,

    title: "Georges Seurat",
    description:
      '<p>Inspired by recently published research in optical and color theory, Georges Seurat distinguished his art from what the Impressionists considered a more intuitive painting approach by developing his own “scientific” style called Pointillism. Tackling the issues of color, light, and form, Seurat’s method juxtaposed tiny dabs of colors to create hues that he believed, through optical blending, were more intense and luminous.</p><p>Although Seurat embraced the subject matter of modern life preferred by artists such as Claude Monet and Pierre-Auguste Renoir, he went beyond their concern for translating paint qualities of light in nature. Rather, Seurat sought to evoke permanence by recalling the art of the past, especially Egyptian and Greek sculpture and even Italian Renaissance frescoes, although some contemporary critics found his figures to be less a nod to earlier art history than a commentary on the posturing and artificiality of modern Parisian society.</p><p>“Bedlam,” “scandal,” and “hilarity” were among the epithets used to describe what is now considered Georges Seurat’s greatest work—<a href="/artworks/27992/a-sunday-on-la-grande-jatte-1884"><em>A Sunday on La Grande Jatte—1884</em></a><em>—</em>when it was first exhibited in Paris. Recognized for its unusual technique, simplified figure types, and enormous scale, the monumental work is a manifesto of the new style of painting that broke with Impressionism.</p>',

    title: "John Singer Sargent",
    description:
      '<p>John Singer Sargent was the most sought-after portraitist of his generation on both sides of the Atlantic. Best known for his powerful, vibrant portraits, Sargent nevertheless excelled in a variety of genres, including landscapes, watercolors, and murals. Born in Florence to American parents, he lived abroad, traveling the world in search of his subjects and working professionally for more than 50 years.</p><p>Sargent first exhibited at the Art Institute—at the time located at Michigan Avenue and Van Buren Street—in 1890, drawing crowds of visitors to the museum and helping to put Chicago on the map as a recognized center for contemporary art and culture. His ability to straddle the line between tradition and the avant-garde continued to impress audiences and collectors at the 1893 World’s Columbian Exposition in Chicago. Sargent’s work was regularly featured in the galleries of the Art Institute as well as other venues and homes in the city. Foundational collectors in Chicago, including Charles Deering, Martin A. Ryerson, and Annie Swan Coburn, helped to secure Sargent’s presence, and eventual legacy, in the city.<br></p><p><a href="/exhibitions/2522/">A 2018 exhibition</a> at the Art Institute examined Sargent’s impressive breadth of artistic accomplishment and the many connections between the artist, his patrons, his creative circle, and the city of Chicago.</p>',

    title: "Ivan Albright",
    description:
      '<p>Chicago native Ivan Albright remains one of the most uncompromising artists of the 20th century, a “master of the macabre” famous for his richly detailed paintings of ghoulish subjects. A medical draftsman during World War I, Albright portrayed the body’s vulnerability—to age, disease, and death—in works that provoked outrage and admiration.&nbsp;</p><p>For Albright, art was a family business. His father, Adam Emory Albright (1862–1957), was a commercially successful painter who had several one-person exhibitions at the Art Institute in the early 20th century, but his son rebelled against what he called this “pretty pretty” art. While Albright’s unique style has been called Magic Realism, it defies categorization. His painstaking creative process involved designing sets for his paintings and creating studies of models and props—even making diagrammatic plans for colors. Albright’s desire to present the minutest subtleties of human flesh or the tiniest elements of a still life often required that he spend years on a single painting.&nbsp;</p><p>A graduate of the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, Albright established a reputation in the city through early support from the museum, which displayed and purchased many of his paintings. As the largest public collection of Albright works, the Art Institute has organized <a href="https://www-2018.artic.edu/search/exhibitions?q=ivan+albright" target="_blank">several exhibitions </a>showcasing his unconventional style and the controversial subject matter that earned him fame and notoriety throughout his career.</p>',

    title: "Maria Helena Vieira da Silva",
    description:
      '<p>Maria Helena Vieira da Silva left her hometown Lisbon in 1928 with the intention to study sculpture at the Académie La Grande Chaumière in Paris. Amid the vibrant Parisian art scene, her interests extended to painting, which she studied with <a href="https://www.artic.edu/artists/35363" target="_blank">Fernand Léger</a>, among others. In the mid 1930s, Vieira da Silva began working in increasingly abstract modes. Yet abstraction was never Vieira da Silva’s only concern—even earlier in her life, her excitement with the speed of modern life led to an interest in the dynamic pictorial strategies of the Italian Futurists, but she also reacted strongly against those artists’ alliance with Fascism.</p><p>In 1936, as right-wing extremists were gaining influence in Europe, Vieira da Silva actively debated the merits of abstraction and realism with fellow politically aware artists, particularly the artist’s group Amis de Monde, which met in a Paris café. It was in this context that she painted <a href="https://www.artic.edu/artworks/53001/composition?q=composition+silva" target="_blank"><em>Composition</em></a><em> (</em>1936–1937), a significant early abstraction that demonstrates her diverse visual interests. The colorful planes of the painting’s central mass suggest checkered textiles as much as they do the artist’s favored <em>azulejos</em>, decorative ceramic tiles common in Lisbon, which Vieira da Silva collected from periods as early as the fifteenth century. This painting anticipates later shifts in her work towards abstracted urban space and the stark verticals of modern architecture and engineering, such as in <a href="https://www.artic.edu/artworks/53004/rotterdam?q=rotterdam+silva" target="_blank"><em>Rotterdam</em></a><em> </em>(1956).</p><p>When Hitler invaded Poland in 1939, Vieira da Silva and her husband, the Hungarian-Jewish artist Árpád Szenes, left Paris to move back to her native Lisbon. Because of her marriage to Szenes, the Portuguese government revoked Vieira da Silva’s citizenship, and the couple moved once again, traveling on documents issued by the League of Nations to Rio de Janeiro. They would stay there seven years, becoming friends with important Brazilian modernist poets such as Murilo Mendes, receiving federal commissions, and exhibiting at the Museu Nacional de Belas Artes.</p><p>After Vieira da Silva returned to Paris in 1947, the French government purchased important works from this period such as <em>La partie d’échecs</em> (The Chess Game), 1943, now in the collection of the Centre Pompidou, which demonstrate her ongoing negotiations of abstraction and figuration that would continue through the rest of her life. As she saw it, abstraction, politics, and the everyday were all part of the experience of life: “Everything amazes me. I paint my amazement, which at the same time is delight, fear and laughter. I do not want to exclude anything from this amazement. I want to paint pictures with many things, with all the contradictions . . .”</p>',

    title: "Diteka",
    description:
      '<p>Active early to mid-20th century<br>Makonde<br>Northern Mozambique or southern Tanzania</p><p>Makonde helmet masks, such as this intricate example, incarnate ancestral spirits who temporarily return among their living descendants on earth. These masks appear in dances that celebrate the conclusion of initiation rituals of adolescent boys and girls in the border region between Mozambique and Tanzania.</p><p>The Art Institute’s Makonde mask is distinguished from its handful of counterparts in American art museums by an engraving in Kiswahili on its cheek, which reads “Wakugonga Diteka,” a claim that memorializes the artist’s proper name: Diteka. This inscription signals that, like many other examples of traditional African art, this was not the work of an anonymous “craftsman” but rather the creation of an inventive artist who enjoyed fame in his community and was fully aware of his special talents.</p><p>Once owned by the famous French artist <a href="https://www.artic.edu/artists/37453" target="_blank">Arman</a> (1928–2005) and featured in the legendary exhibition <em>“Primitivism” in 20th-Century Art</em> at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 1984, the helmet mask is characterized by the realistic imitation of incised angular facial scarification marks, while its dark brown surface color suggests it represents a male character.</p>',

    title: "Ah Maxam",
    description:
      '<p>Active in the mid- to late eighth century, Ah Maxam was a member of the royal lineage of the kingdom of Naranjo, in the Petén region of Guatemala. Although we know little about his life, his works <a href="https://www.artic.edu/artworks/65290/vessel-of-the-dancing-lords" target="_blank"><em>Vessel of the Dancing Lords</em></a> (AD 750/800) and <a href="https://www.artic.edu/artworks/126858/water-lily-vessel" target="_blank"><em>Water-Lily Vessel</em></a> (AD 750/800) attest to his refined abilities as an artist.</p><p>The simple and elegant designs of his vessels, executed with a perfectly controlled brush, incorporate natural elements, religious scenes, and hieroglyphic text, highlighting important features and beliefs of Mayan culture. As its name implies, <em>Water-Lily Vessel </em>is painted with water lilies, which for the Maya symbolized the watery surface of the underworld and the earth’s regenerative powers. The informative inscription on <em>Water-Lily Vessel</em>—the first to be deciphered on a Classic Maya vessel—states the artist’s name, declaring that Ah Maxam is a member of the nobility of Naranjo. It also mentions his mother and father, whose names appear on other dynastic monuments from the region.</p><p>According to ancient Maya belief, the gods only succeeded in populating the earth when they shaped humanity from maize, the staff of life. Ah Maxam’s <em>Vessel of the Dancing Lords</em> depicts a Maya ruler dressed as the maize god in three almost-identical panels. The ruler wears an enormous rack containing brilliant feathers, heraldic beasts, and related emblems, and is shown in the company of a dwarf. To the Maya aristocracy, dwarfs were special beings, with powerful connections to the earth and the underworld, the home of the ancestral dead. Consequently, the vase may refer to a rite of passage in which dwarfs assist the soul of the deceased to the land of the dead. <em>Vessel of the Dancing Lords </em>may have been painted as a funerary offering for a noblewoman with dynastic connections in the city of Naranjo, where it was made.</p>',

    title: "Grant Wood",
    description:
      '<p>Grant Wood is known for his stylized and subtly humorous scenes of rural people, Iowa cornfields, and mythic subjects from American history—such as the Art Institute’s iconic painting <a href="https://www.artic.edu/artworks/6565/american-gothic" target="_blank"><em>American Gothic</em></a> (1930). Along with other Midwestern Regionalist painters like <a href="https://www.artic.edu/artists/40511" target="_blank">John Steuart Curry</a> and <a href="https://www.artic.edu/artists/2137" target="_blank">Thomas Hart Benton</a>, Wood advocated for a realistic style and recognizable subjects that showed local places and common people, a radically different approach from European modernism and its push toward abstraction. </p><p>Living most of his life in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, Wood studied metalsmithing with Arts and Crafts movement designer Ernest A. Batchelder before moving to Chicago in 1913. There he worked at <a href="https://www.artic.edu/artists/35185" target="_blank">Kalo Silversmiths Shop</a> while taking fine arts classes in the evenings at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. Inspired by the Northern Renaissance art he saw on a trip to Munich, Germany in 1928, Wood shifted from the free, impressionistic style evident in the Art Institute’s </p><p><a href="https://www.artic.edu/artworks/156075/loch-vale" target="_blank"><em>Loch Vale</em></a><em> </em>(1927) to the highly detailed, tightly painted forms that characterize <em>American Gothic</em>. Exhibited publicly for the first time at the Art Institute in 1930, <em>American Gothic</em> won Wood a $300 prize and instant fame. </p><p>Wood galvanized his success by co-founding the Stone City Colony and Art School in Iowa and also teaching in the art department at the University of Iowa, heralding the message of Regionalism in the face of a move towards increasing abstraction in American art. His later works continued to celebrate, and sometimes satirize, Midwestern values and people. The iconic imagery he created in <em>American Gothic </em>and subsequent works has been adapted and parodied regularly, serving as a reflection of changing American values and ways.</p>',

    title: "Andy Warhol",
    description:
      '<p>No artist is more closely associated with advertising, consumer culture, and mass media than Andy Warhol. Through his brazen appropriation of images and his radical use of the photo-emulsion silkscreen process, the artist became synonymous with Pop. His ability to produce the same image—over and over, quickly and efficiently—upset traditional boundaries between fine and commercial art. In his most distinctive works, Warhol embraced both consumer products and Hollywood personalities, rendering Campbell’s Soup cans and Coca-Cola bottles as stars and celebrities like Elvis Presley, <a href="https://www-2018.artic.edu/collection?q=Marilyn+Monroe+%28Marilyn%29&amp;categoryQuery=Warhol&amp;artist_ids=Andy+Warhol" target="_blank">Marilyn Monroe</a>, and <a href="https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229406/liz-3-early-colored-liz?q=Liz+Taylor" target="_blank">Elizabeth Taylor</a> as products—and vice versa.&nbsp;</p><p>Born in Pittsburgh, Warhol studied pictorial design at the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University). He moved to New York during the post–World War II economic boom and worked throughout the 1950s as an illustrator for clients that included I.&nbsp;Miller Shoes, Tiffany and Company, and <em>Vogue</em>. He brought the same savvy entrepreneurial approach of his advertising work to his first engagements in 1961 with Pop Art, a movement that began in Great Britain in the 1950s. Throughout his life, Warhol remained captivated by celebrity and the role that media plays in fashioning persona, ideas he explored in his social and artistic production and through experiments in underground cinema, publishing, photography, and performance.</p><p>Many of the iconic paintings in the Edlis Neeson Collection at the Art Institute emphasize Warhol’s engagement with portraiture. For <a href="https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229356/twelve-jackies?q=Twelve+Jackies" target="_blank"><em>Twelve Jackies</em></a> (1964), which comes from a body of work created shortly after the death of John&nbsp;F. Kennedy, Warhol selected a press photograph of the former first lady at the president’s funeral following his assassination. By cropping and enlarging the image, Warhol focused attention on his subject much like a film director using a close-up lens, ultimately conveying that notoriety could be found even, and perhaps especially, in tragedy. <a href="https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229357" target="_blank"><em>Little Race Riot</em></a><em> </em>(1964) and <a href="https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229360" target="_blank"><em>Big Electric Chair</em></a><em> </em>(1967–68) similarly express Warhol’s fixation on the disturbing realities of violence that haunt American life, while two <a href="https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229358" target="_blank">self-portraits of 1964</a> and <a href="https://www-2018.artic.edu/artworks/229359" target="_blank">1966</a> poetically demonstrate his obsession with his own self-image. </p>',
